# Favor Composition over Inheritance (FCoI)
## Purpose

The Purpose of this Project is to show good and bad examples for the Favor Composition over Inheritance (FCoI)
principle.
It was created for purely educational purposes as a school-project and is not meant to be used in any professional
capacity.

## Structure

The examples are made in Java and will be split into two packages: `good` and `bad`.
Each file contains a class with an example of the principle in action.
The code will be explained using comments, in order to give more insight.

# What is FCoI?

Favor Composition over Inheritance is a principle in object-oriented programming that suggests that classes should 
preferably be implemented using composition over inheritance. This means that classes should be designed to be composed of other classes, rather
than inheriting from a parent class.

This is because inheritance can lead to a number of problems, such as the fragile base class problem, the duplication of
code, and the inability to change the behavior of a class at runtime.
Composition, on the other hand, allows for greater flexibility and reusability, as classes can be composed of other
classes at runtime, rather than being bound to a parent class at compile time.
