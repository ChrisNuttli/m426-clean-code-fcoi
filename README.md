# Favor Composition over Inheritance (FCoI)
## Purpose

The Purpose of this Project is to show good and bad examples for the Favor Composition over Inheritance (FCoI)
principle.
It was created for purely educational purposes as a school-project and is not meant to be used in any professional
capacity.

## Structure

The examples are made in Java and will be split into two packages: `good` and `bad`.
Each file contains a class with an example of the principle in action.
The code will be explained using comments, in order to give more insight.
