# Favor Composition over Inheritance (FCoI)
## Purpose

The Purpose of this Project is to show good and bad examples for the Favor Composition over Inheritance (FCoI)
principle.
It was created for purely educational purposes as a school-project and is not meant to be used in any professional
capacity.

## Structure

The examples are made in Java and will be split into multiple packages, where each package demonstrates a situation
where composition is more favorable than inheritance.
There will be 2 files in each Package, that show a good example and a bad example (they are named accordingly).

The code will be explained using comments, in order to give more insight.
